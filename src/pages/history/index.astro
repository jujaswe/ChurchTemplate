        <h3>PROVENANCE AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT</h3>
        <p>
          Santo Entierro -- This is a sacred image depicting the lifeless body of Christ. It holds profound
          historical and familial significance for the people of Virac, Catanduanes. This revered image
          was commissioned by the late spouses AMBROSIO TABLIZO and INES LEONARDO,
          devout Catholics and respected members of the community. They were blessed with five
          children: SEVERO, ANDRES, FELIX, MARIA and JUANA. Inspired by their deep faith
          and the enduring traditions of Holy Week introduced during the Spanish colonial period,
          Ambrosio and Ines envisioned the Santo Entierro not only as an object of veneration but as a
          unifying symbol for their family. Their intention was to create a spiritual heirloom — one that
          would serve as a compelling reason for their children and future generations to return home
          to Virac every Semana Santa (Holy Week), regardless of where life had taken them. Years
          passed and the children got married except Andres who became a priest. The firstborn,
          SEVERO, was married to CARMEN ARCILLA with seven (7) offsprings. The second
          child, FR. ANDRES unexpectedly had five (5) offsprings while the third child, FELIX was
          married to RUFINA ACHAVAL with five (5) offspring. The fourth child, MARIA was
          married to EUSEBIO TALION with eleven (11) offsprings while the youngest, JUANA, was
          married to ARSENIO TEVES were childless.

        <h3>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HOLY IMAGE TO THE TABLIZO FAMILY</h3>
        <p>
          The holy image has long served as the unifying symbol for the Tablizo siblings, honoring the
          wishes of their parents who instructed them to take turns hosting the family’s Holy Week
          observance. Over the decades, this tradition has strengthened their bond and sense of duty.
          The Santo Entierro has become more than just a sacred image—it is a revered centerpiece of
          the Good Friday procession in Virac, solemnly carried through the streets as part of the town’s
          deeply rooted Lenten traditions. It stands as a living legacy of faith, family unity, and cultural
          identity, passed down through generations.
        </p>

        <h3>THE ORIGINAL HOME OF THE HOLY IMAGE</h3>
        <p>
          According to the Book of the Virac Cathedral, records indicate that during a pastoral visit in
          1817, the Bishop of Nueva Caceres was notably impressed by the Church of Virac. The parish
          then presided over numerous ermitas (chapels) situated both within the poblacion and in the
          outlying areas. These community chapels, built primarily in the last quarter of the 19th century
          and into the early American period, were often mistaken for parish churches due to their
          substantial size and durable stone construction. Notable examples of these still stand in the
          barangays of Gogon, Rawis, and Sta. Elena. (The Virac Cathedral, pp. 24–25).
          <br /><br />
          From this historical context, it is reasonable to deduce that the revered image of the Santo
          Entierro was acquired by the devout couple Ambrosio Tablizo and Ines Leonardo during this
          flourishing period of religious devotion — estimated to be not less than 160 years ago. At that
          time, the couple resided in Barangay San Pedro, in a house that now belongs to the heirs of
          their son, Severo Tablizo. Remarkably, this original ancestral home still stands today, a silent
          witness to the family’s enduring faith and devotion. Behind the house, the couple built a small
          shrine or shelter known as a camarin, where the Santo Entierro was reverently enshrined and
          safeguarded. In or around the year 1927, a mysterious incident occurred: for three consecutive
          nights, the windows of the camarin were found open — an unsettling occurrence interpreted
          by the family as a bad omen. In response, the image was promptly relocated to the residence
          of a relative of Ines Leonardo in Barangay Gogon. The following night, a fire of unknown
          origin consumed the camarin. Remarkably, the Santo Entierro had already been transferred
          and was spared from the blaze — an event widely regarded as miraculous. Instead of
          reconstructing the destroyed camarin, the family chose to house the image in a large wooden
          box, which was then placed at the St. Raphael Chapel in Gogon. It remained there even
          through the Japanese occupation during World War II. In later years, however, parishioners
          began to express concern that the box obscured the sacred presence of the image and was
          visually unappealing.
          <br /><br />
          In response, a Memorandum of Agreement was entered into between the Bishop of Virac and
          the Caretaker of the St. Raphael Chapel, on one side, and the heirs of Ambrosio Tablizo and
          Ines Leonardo, on the other. This agreement formally authorized the image’s public display
          at the chapel, allowing for its continued veneration by the faithful. In time, the sacred
          responsibility of caring for the Santo Entierro was passed down to Juanito A. Tablizo, the
          youngest son of Severo and a third-generation descendant. He faithfully carried out this duty
          until his passing. The role was then entrusted to his grandnephew, Rodolfo Kim Arevalo
          Chiong, a fifth-generation descendant. Today, he continues this sacred family tradition. Each
          Holy Week, he solemnly retrieves the image from the St. Raphael Chapel on Holy Tuesday,
          ensures its preparation and presence for the Good Friday procession, and returns it with
          reverence to the chapel on Black Saturday.
        </p>
        
        <h3>THE WRITTEN AGREEMENT OF THE FIVE (5) CHILDREN OF AMBROSIO TABLIZO & INES LEONARDO</h3>
        <p>
          A written agreement, composed in the Bicol language, exists among the five children of
          Ambrosio and Ines Tablizo. This document affirms that only the direct heirs and descendants
          of Severo, Andres, Felix, and Maria shall hold the exclusive right and privilege to take part in
          the traditional hosting of the Holy Week event during Semana Santa. It is clearly stipulated
          that their youngest sister, Juana, who remained childless, and consequently has no heirs, shall
          not be included in the rotation. This agreement, rooted in mutual respect and commitment to
          their parents’ wishes, continues to serve as a guiding principle for the family’s enduring
          Lenten tradition.
        </p>
        
        <h3>BIRTH OF THE FOUNDATION</h3>
        <p>
          Today, members of the fourth generations continue to honor the original purpose of the image.
          It remains not only a vessel of devotion but a reminder of the love, foresight, and values of
          Ambrosio and Ines — ensuring that each Holy Week becomes a moment of reunion,
          reflection, and renewal for the Tablizo-Leonardo family and their descendants. For several
          decades, the family envisioned formalizing their association of descendants representing the
          heirs of the four siblings with offspring. Although drafts of the constitution and by-laws had
          been prepared, these efforts were not realized until July 2023. Through Facebook Messenger,
          representatives from the four siblings (excluding the childless daughter - Juana), organized
          and elected officers, leading to the establishment of the Santo Entierro de Virac Foundation,
          Inc., which was subsequently registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
        </p>

        <b>DISCLAIMER:</b> The historical background presented in this document is based on oral
        narratives, personal accounts and some available documents shared by members of the third
        generation of the Tablizo family during their lifetime. It also draws from the collective
        memory and knowledge of the fourth generation, as passed down to them by their elders.
        While every effort has been made to preserve the accuracy and integrity of these accounts,
        this compilation remains a work in progress. Ongoing research continues to verify and enrich
        the narrative with additional facts and historical details as they become available. This
        document is therefore intended as a living record—open to refinement as the family’s story
        continues to unfold and as new information is discovered.
