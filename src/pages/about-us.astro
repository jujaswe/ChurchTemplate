          <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8">
            The Santo Entierro de Virac Foundation, Inc. is committed to building an
            iconic chapel and its amenities to house the revered Holy Image of Santo Entierro, a religious
            treasure with over 160 years of spiritual significance. Our goal is to create a legacy of faith
            and devotion. Beyond the physical structure, we dedicate ourselves to promoting religious
            pilgrimage destination, preserving the cultural heritage of Catanduanes, and extending
            compassionate support to the needy through charitable programs that uplift families and
            strengthen the spiritual fabric of the community. Through these efforts, we aim to inspire
            future generations to embrace faith, honor tradition, and embody the values of compassion,
            service, and unity.

          <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8">
            To create a sacred sanctuary in Virac, Catanduanes, honoring the more than
            160- year-old Holy Image of Santo Entierro, a cherished family heirloom from spouses
            Ambrosio and Ines Tablizo — a symbol of unwavering faith and a significant part of the
            Municipality of Virac religious heritage. Through this iconic chapel, we aspire to foster
            spiritual devotion, promote religious tourism, and serve as a beacon of charitable service,
            enriching the lives of both pilgrims and the local community.
